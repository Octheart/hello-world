# hello-world
Prints Jefferson Chen's "hello, world" on the screen.

My name is Jefferson Chen, and I am a business member of High School FIRST FRC team 3341. I'm decently acquainted with Linux and I hope to develop in computer science over the course of my lifetime. By building a foundation for myself, I can help others learn how awesome life can be without trivial things weighing them down. Hello world!
